### Purpose
This code was built to generate a star system map with planets, moons, and other objects. I plan to use this in an MFD or readout display for a scifi control panel but it should be adaptable to other uses.
### Sources
Based on zerot69's Solar System Simulation repo on github. Their  Planet class was used as a template for my Planet and Moon classes. I will likely  forget to update this, so I may have incorporated other functions from Solar System Simulation at the time of reading. His app is a colorful recreation of our solar system with a different purpose  and feature set than this one, so make sure to check it out at the link below! \
